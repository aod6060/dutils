For teirs 2 to 5 recipes I'm going to generate the recipes using java... These recipes will 
have a simple interface that will execute a simple interface that will have several variables

1) There will be two different types of meta data.
	- 1 for the pill input ingredent
	- 2 for the pill output result
	
2) The interface should be a single line so it be simple for lambda for example...


public interface IPillRecipeFunction {
	void handlePill(int input, int output, String name);
}
